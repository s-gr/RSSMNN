    "I was very disappointed with the outcome of my work connected to the task you gave me. I tried a lot to get the algorithm running and so focused on getting it to work that I did not have time in the end to really present which steps I took to improve the outcome of my predictive model. As mentioned in the interview, I do not have a lot of experience in running these sort of algorithms, which is why I was often doubting my implementation and checking it several times. But I wanted to understand, what went wrong, so I also tried other algorithms like a random forest, which instantly got better, but still not good enough results. So I decided to really overfit my NN and let it train for over 8 hours but with no real improvement. \n",

    "I then decided to get rid of the entity embedings and return to simple one hot encodings using sci-kit learn preprocessing tools. This also did bring any major improvements. I basically had a loss using the mean aboslute error of 4. In the context of bike rentals, this translates that on average my algorithm was off 4 bike rentals on a specifc station, year and weekday. \n",

    "So I decided to get back to the feature engineering and generate more features out of the date column. In the beginning, I did not do that to be quicker in testing the algorithm.\n",
